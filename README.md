# GroupWatch

## Environment Variables

Make sure to add the necessary environment variables before running.  

## Running Locally

Development mode runs the client and server separately (the server will not serve the client) and watches for changes.  
Production mode builds both the client and server, then runs the server (which serves the client and API).  

* `npm run client:dev` - Run client in development mode  
* `npm run server:dev` - Run server in development mode  
* `npm run dev` - Run full application in development mode  
* `npm run build && npm run start` - Run full application in production mode
